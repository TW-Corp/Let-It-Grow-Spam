Our son Wesley kinda glows, And thats not good so we suppose, We should let it grow. Let it grow, let it grow, You cant reap what you dont sow! Plant the seed inside the earth, Just one way, to know its worth. Celebrate the worlds rebirth, We say let it grow. My names Marie, And I am three! And I would like to see a tree, La la la la la lala lee, I say let it grow. Im Grammy Norma - Im old and Ive got gray hair, But I remember when trees were everywhere,And no one had to pay for air! So I say, let it grow! Let it grow, let it grow, Like it did so long ago. It is just one tiny seed, But its all we really need, Time to change your life with deed, Time to let it grow. My names OHare, Im one of you. I live here in Thneedville, too. The things you say just might be true. It could be time, to start anew. Maybe change my point of view! Nah! I say let it die! Let it die, let it die, Let it shrivel up and - Come on whos with me? No body. You greedy dirtbag! Let it grodf, let it grow, Let the love inside you show! Plant the seed inside the earth,Just one way, to know its worth! Celebrate the worlds rebirth, We say let it grow!", 'textBox');
